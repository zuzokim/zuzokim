<p align="center">
<p>Web Frontend Engineer, currently based in Seoul.</p>
<p>
Rather than working to the point of exhaustion, I take an <b>ownership-driven approach to engineering</b>, focusing on what truly matters for the product. I have a strong interest in bridging the gap between user needs and the way engineers approach problem-solving.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy discussing the problems we are solving with my colleagues and find great satisfaction in <b>working together</b> to refine and improve our code!
